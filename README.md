*Binary Search Tree Visualizer*

This is a project I started for the Opcommathon hackathon. It has three stages: 

1. Create a binary search tree with all the functions it should have. (done! All removal, search, and insertion operations complete.)

2. Create a visualizer for the command prompt. (skipped for now to focus on data structures)

3. Create a Red/Black Tree with all the standard functions. (Auto-balancing needs a lot of polish, but core functionality works!
