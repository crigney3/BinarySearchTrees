*Binary Search Tree Visualizer*

This is a project I started for the Opcommathon hackathon. It has three stages: 

1. Create a binary search tree with all the functions it should have. (Almost done!)

2. Create a visualizer for the command prompt.

3. Create a Red/Black Tree with all the standard functions.
